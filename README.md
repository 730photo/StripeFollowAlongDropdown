# StripeFollowAlongDropdown

<h5>
This was the 26th project from the #JavaScript30 that i've completed. I built a landing page with a really cool navigation feature. When you hover over top of something it shows a dropdown list and when also, the background of the dropdown is able to transform itself from the width and the height as well as wherever it is on the page.
